# Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis of histologic subtypes in Lung Adenocarcinoma

This repository contains code and analysis pipelines for a study of the cellular and spatial architecture underlying histologic subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), based on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (10x Visium).

## Summary

### Background
Tumor histology reflects disease aggressiveness and clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) are classified based on predominant histologic patterns, including high-grade micropapillary and solid subtypes, which are associated with unfavorable clinical features and prognosis. However, the cellular and molecular features underlying these histologic subtypes remain poorly understood.

### Methods
We used scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics (10x Visium) to profile **117,266 cells** from **18 treatment-naïve LUADs** with heterogeneous histologic patterns. By integrating single-cell transcriptional states with spatial information, we characterized the cellular identity and spatial organization driving LUAD heterogeneity.

### Results
Our analyses show that histologic subtypes can be distinguished by:

- subtype-specific cancer cell subpopulations, and  
- immunosuppressive phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment (TME).

We dissect intercellular interactions among cancer cells, macrophages, and CD8⁺ T cells in the prognostically unfavorable solid subtype, revealing how these interactions drive cancer cell plasticity and promote an immunosuppressive TME. Furthermore, we identify **HMGA1** as a potential clinically relevant biomarker and therapeutic target for solid-subtype LUAD.

### Conclusions
These findings deepen our understanding of the histologic heterogeneity of LUAD and may facilitate the development of subtype-specific biomarkers and targeted therapeutic strategies.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following main components (folder names can be adjusted to your repo structure):

- `data/`  
  - Small example data and metadata (non-sensitive / de-identified) to demonstrate the pipeline.  
  - **Note:** Full raw and processed data are hosted externally (see *Data availability* below).

- `scripts/`  
  - Analysis scripts for scRNA-seq preprocessing, spatial analysis, intercellular interaction analysis, and figure generation.  
  - (Script list and descriptions can be added here as the repository is finalized.)


- `figures/`  
  - Output figures (low-resolution or example plots) generated by the analysis pipeline.

## Interactive Data Exploration (cellxgene)

Interactive visualization of selected processed datasets is available via **cellxgene**:

- LUAD single-cell atlas (this study):  
  👉 [Open in cellxgene] TBA

Through the cellxgene interface, users can:
- explore cell type and subtype annotations,  
- inspect distributions across histologic subtypes and samples.
